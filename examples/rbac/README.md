## RBAC Example

This example shows how to use the agentgateway to perform MCP native RBAC.

### Running the example

```bash
cargo run -- -f examples/rbac/config.json
```

Let's look at the config to understand what's going on. First off we have a listener, which tells the gateway how to listen for incoming requests/connections. In this case we're using the `sse` listener, which is a simple HTTP listener that listens on port 3000. In addition we have a JWT authentication section, which tells the gateway how to authenticate the incoming requests. In this case we're using a local JWT public key file to authenticate the incoming requests.

In addition, we have a RBAC section, which tells the gateway how to authorize the incoming requests. In this case we're using a static policy, which is a list of policies that are applied to the incoming requests.
```json
  "listeners": [
    {
      "sse": {
        "address": "0.0.0.0",
        "port": 3000,
        "authn": {
          "jwt": {
            "issuer": [
              "me"
            ],
            "audience": [
              "me.com"
            ],
            "local_jwks": {
              "file_path": "manifests/jwt/pub-key"
            }
          }
        },
        "rbac": [
          {
            "name": "default",
            "rules": [
              {
                "key": "sub",
                "value": "me",
                "resource": {
                  "type": "TOOL",
                  "id": "everything:echo"
                },
                "matcher": "EQUALS"
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
```


Finally we have a targets section, which tells the gateway how to proxy the incoming requests to the target. In this case we're proxying to the [Everything](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/blob/main/src/everything) server.
```json
  "targets": {
    "mcp": [
      {
        "name": "everything",
        "stdio": {
          "cmd": "npx",
          "args": [
            "@modelcontextprotocol/server-everything"
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
```

Now that we have the gateway running, we can use the [mcpinspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector) to try it out.
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

Now that we have the inspector running, let's connect to the gateway, for this tutorial we'll need to use a JWT token. If we try without we will get an error.

```

Now that we're connected, let's try out the echo tool.

![Echo](./img/echo.png)

That worked because we have access to it via the policy. Let's try out the addPet tool.

That didn't work because we don't have access to it via the policy.
